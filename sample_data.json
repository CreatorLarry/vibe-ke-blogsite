Popular lodges include Keekorok Lodge, Mara Serena Lodge, and Olare Motorogi Camp.\n\nFor the best experience, book your safari well in advance, especially if you're planning to visit during peak season (August-September). Early morning and late afternoon game drives offer the best wildlife viewing opportunities.\n\nRemember to pack appropriate clothing, a good camera, and insect repellent. The experience of witnessing the migration is truly unforgettable.",
